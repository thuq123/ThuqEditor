ThuqEditor

ThuqEditor is my first ever project, intending to be a simple text editor like Notepad. It's my first ever project in python too which is pretty cool I think. All backend work was done on the file "fileEditor.py"

the .exe was made with pyinstaller

the setup wizard was made with Inno

:)

Installation:
  Install the latest installer from releases. (WINDOWS ONLY)


Feedback and ideas to improve would be awesome!
