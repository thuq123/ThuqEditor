ThuqEditor

ThuqEditor is my first ever project, intending to be a simple text editor like Notepad. It's my first ever project in python too which is pretty cool I think.

Installation:
  Pretty simple, just download the .exe file from windows and you're good I think...


Feedback and ideas to improve would be awesome!
